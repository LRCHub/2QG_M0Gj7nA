And on that very day my aching heart fell apart
Crumbling in silence
Even though I scream at being broken in inerasable memories
Penetrate my mind and darkness flows into my very own eyes
And I sink into tomorrow whose colors can never be seen

I searched endlessly for the day of reconciliation
Only for the sake of losing it
I will live for the moment
Even when it is useless, I embrace the solitude
(If you turned on the light, if you turned on the light)
I will shine at them!

Emotion brimming with desire will someday change its colors
I've learned
To be the kind of person
Who lives his life with it written inside his heart
Everything around us in this world always gives birth to colors
I'll find it myself to paint tomorrow with my own two hands

Before I could even notice, I was used to losing so much
Even the things that were placed in my hands
Slipped through my fingers, one by one
Before all my tears had gone from my face
The words in which I wanted to hear
Are now for the sake of rescuing someone
(It's all your fate, you gotta do that!)

And if light is becoming stronger then darkness becomes deeper as well
And even if I know that, well I've got nothing to be afraid of
Any kind of heart is capable of giving birth to colors
And my eyes are open since we were gazing upon one another

The breath of sadness, gimme that, woah! (Woah!)
'Cause it's all I'm searching for
To stain it different colors, without raising a sound

Emotion brimming with desire will someday change its colors
I've learned
To be the kind of person
Who lives his life with it written inside his heart
Everything around us in the world always gives birth to colors
And once more they will illuminate within the fingertips of light
(Woah!)

Just do it, just do it
Colors in light and darkness
Just do it, just do it
Colors in light and darkness
The softest colors which were never within our reach
And with my two hands, I'll paint with them
And fix everything again
